### Weekly Recap 

We have been collaborating with Maine DMR folks who install temperature probes on several ventless traps every summer. As seen in the map below, a few dozen Maine lobstermen have been involved with this project since it started in 2007. JiM continues to compile the time series data every few years, generates plots, and archives the information. We much appreciate this contribution to the regional database.

### Realtime Summary (Vessels with Rockblock Satellite Transmitters)

This week, we received `r nrow(dbGetQuery(conn=conn,statement=paste0("SELECT * FROM VESSEL_STATUS WHERE TIMESTAMP >'", lastWeek, "' AND REPORT_TYPE = 'SUMMARY_DATA' AND VESSEL_ID != 23")))` haul-averaged reports from `r nrow(dbGetQuery(conn=conn, statement=paste0("SELECT DISTINCT VESSEL_ID FROM VESSEL_STATUS WHERE TIMESTAMP >'", lastWeek,"' AND REPORT_TYPE = 'SUMMARY_DATA' AND VESSEL_ID != 23")))` vessels.

In the figure above, you can see the approximate locations where we received "Status Reports" (a ping from your system letting us know that it's still working) and "Data Uploads" (actual temperature / depth data collected by your probes). The "Status Reports" come in every 12 hours or so when a system is powered up. "Data Uploads" only come in when you haul the probes. If you were out fishing and don't see your approximate locations on here, please reach out because there may be a problem with your system.

### Bottom Temperature Forecasts

*We plan to add more animations to this section with other models in the future*

#### Northeast Coastal Ocean Forecast System (NECOFS)

Above, please find the bottom temperature forecasts at one hour intervals from 
the Northeast Coastal Ocean Forecast System run by the 
[Chen Lab](http://fvcom.smast.umassd.edu/) at the University of Massachusetts 
School for Marine Science and Technology in New Bedford.
