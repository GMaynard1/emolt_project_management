<h2>Weekly Recap</h2>
<p>Thanks to Owen, who’s been out around the Cape installing new systems
on a number of boats this week! Thanks also to JiM and Huanxin who
finished packing up and mailing out the Vemco Minilog (non-realtime)
sensors for their last deployment this year, and finally, thanks to
Captains Dominic (F/V Tyrant), Curt (F/V Lil More Tail), George (F/V
Eagle), Robert (F/V Darana R), Mark (F/V Prevail), David (R/V Gemma),
Rob (F/V Bookie), and Todd (F/V Voyager) for reaching out to share
reports of malfunctioning deckboxes and suggestions for improvements. We
appreciate all of our industry partners taking the time to let us know
how we can improve the program.</p>
<p>This week, the eMOLT fleet recorded 128 tows of sensorized fishing
gear totaling 960 sensor hours underwater. The warmest recorded bottom
temperature was 60.5 F north of Muskeget Island in approximately 10
fathoms (red profile) and the coldest recorded bottom temperature was
39.3 F east of Cape Ann in approximately 29 fathoms (blue profile).</p>
<p>Water on top of Georges Bank remains well mixed (black profile)
around 50 degrees F, while just off the northern edge in around 80
fathoms, temps drop down to the lower 40s near the bottom (orange
profile). Downeast Maine remains well mixed and cool with temps around
45 F from surface to bottom (purple profile).</p>

<p><em>Figure 1 – Temperature profiles collected by eMOLT participants
over the last week. The blue profile is where the coldest bottom
temperature was measured and the red profile is where the warmest bottom
temperature was measured. All other colors are assigned randomly.
Colored points on the map indicate where profiles of the same color were
collected. The small dark green dots represent other profiles collected
this week, but not highlighted in the plot. Note that the warmest /
coldest bottom temperatures measured could have occurred during gear
soaks, which are not represented on this profile plot.</em></p>

<h3>Cape Cod Bay / Buzzards Bay Physical Oceanography Real Time System
(PORTS) Meeting hosted at Mass Maritime</h3>
<p>NERACOOS organized an interesting meeting yesterday (22 May) at
Massachusetts Maritime Academy to review the status of the <a href="https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/ports/index.html?port=ca">NOAA
Cape Cod Bay and Buzzards Physical Oceanography Real Time System
(PORTS)</a>. There were people from NERACOOS, MassDEP, USCG, MMA, WHG,
ScrippsCDIP, Ørsted, USACE, MassCEC, Northeast Pilots Association,
NOAA/CO-OPS, and NOAA/IOOS. Please excuse this over-use of acronyms but
the point is, the meeting had many partners. While the fishing industry
was not represented, the agenda was not specifically designed for
stakeholders but primarily for those actively involved with the
operations of the various assets. While the focus of the conversations
was vessel safety, JiM attended to present a few slides on the use of
these PORTS datasets for science sake.</p>

<h3>A Note on the Importance of Cooperative Research from Dr. Sarah
Gaichas</h3>
<p>Recently retired NEFSC scientist Dr. Sarah Gaichas <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/fshmag/vuaf019">published a column in
Fisheries magazine</a> (a publication of the American Fisheries Society)
describing some formative experiences early in her career conducting
research aboard commercial fishing boats, and encouraging other
scientists to make the effort to get out on the water with industry
partners as well.</p>
