## Weekly Recap 


> *Figure 1 -- Picture of the Lowell DDH screen aboard the F/V Ryan Joseph showing a noticeable increase in temperature (red) and dissolved oxygen (blue) late on October 29th.*

This week, the eMOLT fleet recorded `r length(unique(full_data$tow_id))` tows of sensorized fishing gear totaling `r as.numeric(sensor_time)` sensor hours underwater. The warmest recorded bottom temperature was `r round(max(full_data$temperature..degree_C.)*9/5+32,1)` F inside Cape Cod Bay in approximately `r round(full_data[which(full_data$temperature..degree_C.==max(full_data$temperature..degree_C.)),"depth..m."]*0.546807,0)` fathoms (red profile) and the coldest recorded bottom temperature was `r round(min(full_data$temperature..degree_C.)*9/5+32,1)` F near Hudson Canyon in approximately `r round(full_data[which(full_data$temperature..degree_C.==min(full_data$temperature..degree_C.)),"depth..m."]*0.546807,0)[1]` fathoms (blue profile). Below, you can see these profiles plus a few other temperature profiles of interest across the region from the last week.

> *Figure 3 -- Temperature profiles collected by eMOLT participants over the last week. The blue profile is where the coldest bottom temperature was measured and the red profile is where the warmest bottom temperature was measured. All other colors are assigned randomly. Colored points on the map indicate where profiles of the same color were collected. The small dark green dots represent other profiles collected this week, but not highlighted in the plot. Note that the warmest / coldest bottom temperatures measured could have occurred during gear soaks, which are not represented on this profile plot.*

### Bottom Temperature Forecasts

#### Doppio 

This week, only 56% of bottom temperature observations were within 2 degrees (F) of the Doppio forecasted value at those points. Across the board, observed bottom temperatures were warmer than expected, but especially down in the Mid-Atlantic east-southeast of Cape May.

![Doppio performance](doppio_compare.png)

> *Figure 5 -- Performance of the Doppio forecast's bottom temperature layer over the last week relative to observations collected by eMOLT participants. Red dots indicate areas where bottom temperature observations were warmer that predicted. Blue dots indicate areas where bottom temperature observations were cooler than predicted. Bottom temperature observations are compared with the most recent forecast run available before the observation was made.*
