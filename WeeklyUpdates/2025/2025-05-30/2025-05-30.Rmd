### Weekly Recap 

### Realtime Summary (Vessels with Rockblock Satellite Transmitters)

This week, we received `r nrow(dbGetQuery(conn=conn,statement=paste0("SELECT * FROM VESSEL_STATUS WHERE TIMESTAMP >'", lastWeek, "' AND REPORT_TYPE = 'SUMMARY_DATA' AND VESSEL_ID != 23")))` haul-averaged reports from `r nrow(dbGetQuery(conn=conn, statement=paste0("SELECT DISTINCT VESSEL_ID FROM VESSEL_STATUS WHERE TIMESTAMP >'", lastWeek,"' AND REPORT_TYPE = 'SUMMARY_DATA' AND VESSEL_ID != 23")))` vessels.

In the figure above, you can see the approximate locations where we received "Status Reports" (a ping from your system letting us know that it's still working) and "Data Uploads" (actual temperature / depth data collected by your probes). The "Status Reports" come in every 12 hours or so when a system is powered up. "Data Uploads" only come in when you haul the probes. If you were out fishing and don't see your approximate locations on here, please reach out because there may be a problem with your system.

### Bottom Temperature Forecasts

*We plan to add more animations to this section with other models in the future*

#### Northeast Coastal Ocean Forecast System (NECOFS)

Above, please find the bottom temperature forecasts at one hour intervals from 
the Northeast Coastal Ocean Forecast System run by the 
[Chen Lab](http://fvcom.smast.umassd.edu/) at the University of Massachusetts 
School for Marine Science and Technology in New Bedford. 

### Announcements and Other News
While browsing the [Canadian IOOS pages](https://catalogue.cioosatlantic.ca/en/organization/cmar], JiM came across some data collected by the Centre of Marine Applied Research (CMAR) and subsequently, after getting on a zoom call with them, downloaded their mooring "sensor string" data and [generated the station plot](https://github.com/jamespmanning/cmar/) below. The cool thing about this mooring data is their  multiple sensors throughout the water column. This may be something we could do in the future on dedicated "science" moorings deployed by fishermen. CMAR maintains a variety of assets including those in the schematic below. We would be most interested in the "Surface Buoy" with a string of sensors. ![cmar station plot]('cmar_stations.png') ![cmar sensor configurations]('sensor_string_configurations.png')

All the best,
