### Weekly Recap 
The drifter program has begun its 2025 season.  The Falmouth MA High School, in coordination with Educational Passages, had a set of units deployed by R/V Tioga on April 8th off Plymouth. As seen in the animation below, they all came ashore within the first week after a few days of strong northerlies. This cluster included 2 miniboats (ashore the first day), 2 mini-drifters, and one standard drifter.  The standard drifter stayed out the longest.  It actually entered the canal where, a few days later, a large pod of right whales were sighted, documenting the possibility that the surface plankton they hunt was advected that way.

Two other drifters, built by Southern Maine Community College students, were deployed this past week off Southern Maine by F/V Captain B and F/V Tenecious, respectively, and can be tracked [here](https://studentdrifters.org/tracks/drift_X.html).

### Realtime Summary (Vessels with Rockblock Satellite Transmitters)

This week, we received `r nrow(dbGetQuery(conn=conn,statement=paste0("SELECT * FROM VESSEL_STATUS WHERE TIMESTAMP >'", lastWeek, "' AND REPORT_TYPE = 'SUMMARY_DATA' AND VESSEL_ID != 23")))` haul-averaged reports from `r nrow(dbGetQuery(conn=conn, statement=paste0("SELECT DISTINCT VESSEL_ID FROM VESSEL_STATUS WHERE TIMESTAMP >'", lastWeek,"' AND REPORT_TYPE = 'SUMMARY_DATA' AND VESSEL_ID != 23")))` vessels.

In the figure above, you can see the approximate locations where we received "Status Reports" (a ping from your system letting us know that it's still working) and "Data Uploads" (actual temperature / depth data collected by your probes). The "Status Reports" come in every 12 hours or so when a system is powered up. "Data Uploads" only come in when you haul the probes. If you were out fishing and don't see your approximate locations on here, please reach out because there may be a problem with your system.

### Bottom Temperature Forecasts

*We plan to add more animations to this section with other models in the future*

#### Northeast Coastal Ocean Forecast System (NECOFS)

Above, please find the bottom temperature forecasts at one hour intervals from 
the Northeast Coastal Ocean Forecast System run by the 
[Chen Lab](http://fvcom.smast.umassd.edu/) at the University of Massachusetts 
School for Marine Science and Technology in New Bedford.
